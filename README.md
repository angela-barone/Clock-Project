# Clock-Project (Personal) 
I designed and customized a cute alarm clock


I use the pomodoro timer all the time, so I decided to create my own in React.

Built with:
HeroIcons
react-howler

To-do:
I want to add pop up images of Greyhounds once the alarm is on: the song I picked as a ringtone referes to the popular greyhound meme on Tiktok
